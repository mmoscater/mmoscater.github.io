<p>Hello, my name is <b>Michael Moscater</b>.</p>
<p>I was born on January 21, 1987 to Gene and Laureen Moscater.  I grew up outside
  Orlando, FL in Casselberry. For most of my life I was very active in sports and technology
  I have a very strong interest in technology now more than ever, and I have pursued this in my 
  career.
</p>
<p>I currently work in Business Intelligence for Frontline Insurance.  I have been employed
  there for 2 years and 3 months.  I started as an IT Business Analyst, but quickly demonstrated
   a keen interest in data and understanding how to create, read, update, and delete data from 
   datawarehouse. I was moved onto a project that would eventually become the Business Intelligence 
   department.
